    "# [Optional] Lab 1: select (aka `copy_if`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If [Lab 1: DAXPY](../lab1_daxpy/daxpy.ipynb) was quick to complete for you, Lab 1 proposes a slightly more advanced example which requires the decomposition of a problem into multiple algorithm calls. You will use different approaches, sequential and parallel, to re-implement the [std::copy_if] algorithm into an API we'll call `select`, which selects some elements of an input vector `v` according to a user-provided criterion, and copies the selected element consecutively into a new vector `w`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is easy to solve sequentially but faces an issue in a concurrent run: the index of write operations into `w` depends on operations performed by other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial condition\n",
    "\n",
    "For all the exercises, the vector `v` is initializer with an filled with pseudo-random numbers that are seeded with a constant value and are therefore identical from one execution to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Select API\n",
    "\n",
    "The API of select we'll implement is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "template <class UnaryPredicate>\n",
    "void select(const std::vector<int>& v, UnaryPredicate pred, \n",
    "            std::vector<size_t>& index, std::vector<int>& w);\n",
    "            \n",
    "```\n",
    "- `v` is the input data,\n",
    "- `pred` the predicate used to select which data copied into the output,\n",
    "- `w` is the output,\n",
    "- and `index` is extra temporary storage that our implementation is allowed to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `w` and `index` may be assumed to contain 0 elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem size and compiler options\n",
