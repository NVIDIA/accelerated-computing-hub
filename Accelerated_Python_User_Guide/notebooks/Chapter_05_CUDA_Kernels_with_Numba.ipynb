Kernels written in Numba have direct access to NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays are transferred between the CPU and the GPU automatically.

    "In Numba, the `@jit` decorator is used to specify a function to be optimized by the Numba just in time compiler.  Within the context of GPU’s we use a version called `@cuda.jit` to specify kernel functions to be optimized for execution by multiple threads on the GPU simultaneously.\n",

    "Don't worry too much about this now. Just take away the idea that we need to specify the number of times we want our kernel to be called, and that is given as two numbers which are multiplied together to give your overall grid size.  This setup will ensure a grid size that has enough threads to handle the size of the data, even if that number is not an exact multiple of the threads per block.\n",

    "Block and grid dimensions will affect CUDA performance.  Larger blocks can lead to better utilization of the shared memory and reduce the overhead of launching many small blocks.
