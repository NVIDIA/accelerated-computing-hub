We explored its fundamental concepts: the kernel-based programming model, data structures like arrays and built-in types, and the just-in-time compilation process that enables near-native performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will apply these concepts to implement a classic statistical model for phase transition: the 2-D Ising model. This serves as an excellent case study for GPU acceleration because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inherent parallelism**: Many lattice sites (subject to smart parallelism, more on this later!) can potentially be updated in parallel\n",
    "2. **Memory access patterns**: Requires careful consideration of interactions with neighboring spins\n",
    "3. **Real-world relevance**: The Ising model is fundamental in various fields, e.g., statistical physics, materials science, etc.\n",

    "## Background: The Ising model in statistical physics\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Ising model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) serves as a framework for understanding phase transitions and critical phenomena. Named after physicist Ernst Ising, this model captures the essential physics of ferromagnetism while being simple enough to simulate and analyze computationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a two-dimensional grid where each site contains a **magnetic spin** that can point either \"up\" (↑) or \"down\" (↓). In mathematical terms, each spin $\\sigma_i$ takes the value $+1$ (up) or $-1$ (down). This seemingly simple setup gives rise to rich dynamics as temperature changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At **low temperatures**: Spins tend to align with their neighbors, creating coherent regions\n",
    "- At **high temperatures**: Thermal fluctuations dominate, leading to random spins and disordered regions\n",
    "- At the **critical temperature**: The system undergoes a phase transition\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to calculate the energy of the system?\n",
    "\n",
    "The total energy of the system is governed by the **Hamiltonian** $H$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(\\sigma) = - J \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us break this down:\n",
    "- **$\\sum_{i \\neq j} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j$**: Sum over all pairs of nearest neighbors (4 neighbors per site in 2-D)\n",
    "- **$J > 0$**: Interaction strength (we will set $J = 1$ for simplicity)  \n",
    "- **$\\sigma_i \\sigma_j$**: Product of neighboring spins\n",
    "\n",
    "- When two neighboring spins are **aligned** ($\\sigma_i = \\sigma_j$): $\\sigma_i \\sigma_j = +1 \\Rightarrow$ energy contribution is $-J$ (lower energy)\n",
    "- When two neighboring spins are **anti-aligned** ($\\sigma_i \\neq \\sigma_j$): $\\sigma_i \\sigma_j = -1 \\Rightarrow$ energy contribution is $+J$ (higher energy)\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a tendency for spins to align with their neighbors at low temperatures. However, as temperature increases, configurations in which adjacent spins are of opposite signs become increasingly probable. This is explained in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Competition between entropy maximization and energy minimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model captures the interplay between two competing effects at the microscopic (lattice site) level:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Energy minimization** (favoring aligned spins): Neighboring spins tend to align to minimize the Hamiltonian\n",
    "2. **Entropy maximization** (favoring anti-aligned spins): Thermal fluctuations tend to randomize neighboring spin orientations\n",
    "\n",
    "The **temperature** $T$ determines the macroscopic state of the system:\n",
    "- **$T \\ll T_c$**: Ordered state of lattice spins\n",
    "- **$T \\gg T_c$**: Disordered state of lattice spins  \n",
    "- **$T \\approx T_c$**: Transition from an ordered to a disordered state\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metropolis-Hastings method for simulating the Ising model\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to calculate the thermodynamic observables, e.g., average magnetization, average internal energy, etc., of the 2-D Ising model as the system moves towards thermal equilibrium. To simulate this transition from the initial state to the state of thermal equilibrium on a computer, we use the [**Metropolis-Hastings algorithm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm) and sample configurations from the **Boltzmann distribution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\sigma) \\propto e^{-H(\\sigma)/(k_B T)} \\tag{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from an initial configuration, we iterate the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection**: Randomly choose a lattice site $i$\n",
    "2. **Proposal**: Consider flipping the spin $\\sigma_i \\rightarrow -\\sigma_i$\n",
    "3. **Energy change**: Calculate $\\Delta E =$ (energy after flip) - (energy before flip)\n",
    "4. **Accept/reject decision**:\n",
    "   - If $\\Delta E \\leq 0$: **Accept** the flip (lower energy is always favorable)\n",
    "   - If $\\Delta E > 0$: **Accept** with probability $P_{accept} = e^{-\\Delta E/(k_B T)}$ (note that as $T \\rightarrow \\infty$, $P_{accept} \\rightarrow 1$ and as $T \\rightarrow 0$, $P_{accept} \\rightarrow 0$)\n",
    "5. **Update**: Apply the flip if accepted, otherwise keep the original spin\n",
    "\n",
    "The acceptance probability $e^{-\\Delta E/(k_B T)}$ ensures that at:\n",
    "- **Low temperatures**: Only energy-lowering moves are likely to be accepted since as $T \\rightarrow 0$, $P_{accept} \\rightarrow 0$\n",
    "- **High temperatures**: Even energy-raising moves can have significant acceptance probability since as $T \\rightarrow \\infty$, $P_{accept} \\rightarrow 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why should we care?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sufficient complexity**: The Metropolis algorithm involves neighbor interactions and probabilistic updates that need to be taken care of while designing the algorithm\n",
    "- **Parallelization challenges**: Naive parallelization leads to race conditions when updating neighboring spins in parallel\n",
    "- **Validation**: The known analytical solution for the 2-D case without an external magnetic field provides a precise benchmark for validating computational results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sections, we will first implement a baseline model using single-threaded, pure Python on the CPU. We will then build an optimized, GPU-accelerated version in NVIDIA Warp, demonstrating a progressive path to a performant simulation that avoids race conditions and faithfully recovers the underlying physics."

    "### Why did our parallel trick fail?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with our double-buffered approach is that it breaks a core rule of the Metropolis algorithm: **the system must evolve sequentially**. Each update needs to depend on the result of the step that came immediately before it. This one-at-a-time process is what guarantees that the physics comes out right.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our baseline sequential Python implementation, this rule is followed correctly: when a spin at a randomly selected site was flipped, its four neighbors immediately saw the new value for any subsequent calculations. This ensures information flows through the lattice in a sequential fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parallel double-buffered approach breaks this flow. Instead of using the most current information, it forces every spin update to be based on a single, old snapshot of the lattice taken at the beginning of the Monte Carlo step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it lacks this essential sequential dependency, the double-buffered method is no longer running the Metropolis algorithm. It is executing a fundamentally different process, which is why it is fast but fails to produce the correct physical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The checkerboard approach\n",

    "The algorithm described below takes care of this potential inconsistency during the update process within a single Monte Carlo step."

    "### Using a checkerboard update\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a technique for handling computational problems with local dependencies on a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm gets its name because we conceptually divide the lattice sites into two groups, like the\n",
    "black and white squares on a chessboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crucially, spins on black squares only have neighbors on white squares, and spins on white squares only have neighbors on black squares. Confirm it yourself in the image below.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of trying to update all lattice sites in one go (which, as we saw with the previous approach, can lead to spin updates not seeing each other's changes within the same Monte Carlo step), we perform two distinct update substeps per Monte Carlo step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Update all \"black\" sites in parallel.** They read the current state of their \"white\" neighbors.\n",
    "2. **Update all \"white\" sites in parallel.** They read the newly updated state of their \"black\" neighbors from step 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two-substep process ensures that when any spin is being updated, the neighbor values it reads are consistent and appropriate for that stage of the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, the figure below shows a $4 \\times 4$ lattice grid with each location being marked as `(unique_id, row_idx, col_idx)`. Here `unique_id` is the unique identification tied to the black/white lattice cell that will remain the same even after decomposing the lattice grid. On the other hand `row_idx, col_idx` correspond to row and column indices specific to the location of the element in the original or decomposed array.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we examined different attempts to simulate the Ising model in two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this exercise was to illuminate some considerations when writing algorithms that run **correctly** and **efficiently** on a GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from a sequential Python version, we encountered a fundamental challenge: while separating the lattice into \"current\" and \"updated\" grids eliminates race conditions, this approach inadvertently alters the underlying physics, producing an algorithm that no longer faithfully reproduces the statistical mechanics of the original sequential implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we saw that a checkerboard algorithm allows us to recover the intended physics while addressing the data dependency issues that hindered the initial approaches."
