    "\n",
    "Warp is a framework from NVIDIA for writing high-performance simulation and graphics code in Python. Central to Warp is a kernel-based programming model in which Python functions are just-in-time (JIT) compiled into efficient code that can run on CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs using C++/CUDA as an intermediate representation. Warp also features a **reverse-mode automatic differentiation** system, which allows researchers to write differentiable simulators that can optionally be incorporated into machine-learning pipelines to train neural networks using PyTorch or JAX. Researchers have applied Warp in areas like physics simulation, perception, robotics, and geometry processing.\n",
