Through this parallel GPU implementation, we learned the importance of developing correct parallelization algorithms to faithfully reproduce the underlying physics of any physical system that we are modeling.\n",

    "Following the theme of simulating physical systems to learn the basics of NVIDIA Warp for parallel computing, in this chapter we will implement an N-body simulation in NVIDIA Warp, first using the single instruction, multiple thread (SIMT) model and then using the tile-based model (both in Warp).\n",

    "Through this implementation, you will learn the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The simulation of another physical system using Warp, building on the previous notebook on the 2-D Ising model\n",
    "* How to characterize code performance and use some code profiling tools available in Warp\n",
    "* An introduction to the tile-based programming method in Warp\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will have two variants of code for N-body simulation, one based on the SIMT paradigm and another based on the tile-based programming model. You will also have learned about tools available in Python and Warp to benchmark your code's time performance in greater detail.\n",

    "\n",
    "An [N-body simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation) models the temporal evolution of a system of particles, typically under the influence of physical forces such as gravity. N-body simulations are widely used in astrophysics to study the dynamics of systems of planets, stars, and galaxies. Readers are strongly encouraged to go through section 31.1 of the [Fast N-Body Simulation with CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-v-physics-simulation/chapter-31-fast-n-body-simulation-cuda) webpage for additional context on why we care about speeding up the N-body simulation.\n",

    "### Numerical setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The N-body simulation in this tutorial evolves a system of particles interacting with each other through gravity. Each particle exerts an attractive gravitational force on every other particle in the system. For a particle given by index $i$ and mass $m_i$, we approximate the net force on the particle $\\mathbf{F}_i$ as:\n",

For convenience and without any loss of generality, we set $G=1$ and do not explicitly use it in the code.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, we saw that a checkerboard algorithm allows us to recover the intended physics while addressing the data dependency issues that hindered the initial approaches."
