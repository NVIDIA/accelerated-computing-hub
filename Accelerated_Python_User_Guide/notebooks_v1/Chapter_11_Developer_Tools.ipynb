    "## CUDA Python Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve optimal performance in CUDA, you must consider several factors:\n",
    "- Localizing memory access in order to minimize memory latency.\n",
    "- Maximizing the number of active threads per multiprocessor to ensure high utilization of your hardware.\n",
    "- Minimization of conditional branching.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to overcome the bottleneck between CPU and GPU across the PCIe bus, we want to:\n",
    "- Minimize the volume of data transferred.  Transferring data in large batches can minimize the number of data transfer operations.\n",
    "- Organize data in a way that complements the hardware architecture.\n",
    "- Utilize asynchronous transfer features that will allow computation and data transfer to occur simultaneously.  Overlapping data transfers with computation can hide latencies caused by data transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Nsight Systems](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems) and [Nsight Compute](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute) are the tools used to detect the bottlenecks and performance flaws in Cuda code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CUDA Python Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA code can sometimes introduce various errors that are not detected by the compiler, such as \n",
    "- Memory access violations\n",
    "- Memory leaks\n",
    "- Data race conditions\n",
    "- Incorrect API usage\n",
    "\n",
    "These errors can lead to incorrect program behavior, crashes, or performance degradation. [Compute Sanitizer](https://developer.nvidia.com/compute-sanitizer) is a suite of runtime error detection tools provided by NVIDIA to help developers identify and debug such issues in CUDA applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "The most common mistake is running a CPU-only code on a GPU node. Only codes that have been explicitly written to run on a GPU can take advantage of a GPU. Ensure your codes are using the correct GPU accelerated libraries, drivers, and hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zero GPU Utilization**\n",
    "Check to make sure your software is GPU enabled.  Only codes that have been explicitly written to use GPUs can take advantage of them.\n",
    "Make sure your software environment is properly configured. In some cases certain libraries must be available for your code to run on GPUs. Check your dependencies, version of CUDA Toolkit, and your software environment requirements.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Low GPU Utilization** (e.g. less than ~15%)\n",
    "Using more GPUs than necessary.  You can find the optimal number of GPUs and CPU-cores by performing a scaling analysis.\n",
    "Check your process’s throughput.  If you are writing output to slow memory, making unnecessary copies, or switching between your CPU and GPU, you may see low utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Errors**\n",
    "Access Violation Errors.  Reading or writing to memory locations that are not allowed or permitted can result in unpredictable behavior and system crashes.\n",
    "Memory Leaks.  When memory is allocated but not correctly deallocated, the application will consume GPU memory resources, but not utilize them.  The allocated memory will not be available for further computation.\n"

    "- **Racecheck** Identifies potential data races in shared memory, which can cause nondeterministic behavior.\n",

    "- **Synccheck** Detects invalid synchronization patterns that could lead to deadlocks or race conditions.\n",

Basically it's a good idea to run it first without any parameters, which will trigger **Memcheck**.
