    "## 9.2. `nvmath-python`: Kernel fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Some computational problems have lower compute to memory access instructions ratio, which can often be addressed by lowering the number of memory accesses via kernel fusion. This exercise illustrate how `nvmath-python` inherently fuses simpler operations into a single composite kernel.\n",

    "### Advanced `matmul` with bias and epilog\n",
    "Based on **Exercise 9.1**, it is not clear why one would need to use `nvmath-python` for matrix multiplications. Indeed, for basic `matmul` operation using `nvmath-python` alongside CuPy does seem an overkill. However, in scientific computing applications and AI, `matmul`s are often used in combination with other operations. For example, in neural networks quite a common usage pattern is as follows.\n",
