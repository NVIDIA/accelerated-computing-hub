    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In many scientific computing workloads, the same operation is performed repeatedly with different data but identical parameters (e.g., matrix shapes, data types, and operation configurations). In such scenarios, performing the full operation setup (specification and planning) for each execution is wasteful. \n",
    "\n",
    "**nvmath-python** addresses this through *stateful APIs* (also called *class-form APIs*), which allow you to separate the specification and planning phases from the execution phase. This enables you to amortize the overhead of setup across multiple executions, significantly improving performance in batch processing scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, **nvmath-python** provides *autotuning* capabilities that search for optimal kernel configurations beyond the default heuristics, further improving performance for specific problem sizes and configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use stateful APIs and autotuning to achieve optimal performance in repeated operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:** To use this notebook, you will need:\n",
    "- A computer equipped with an NVIDIA GPU\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see from the logging output, quite a bit of action happens during the call to `matmul`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SPECIFICATION PHASE:** In this phase, **nvmath-python** analyzes input arguments and creates an internal `Matmul` object with all required data prepared for the underlying [cuBLASLt](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/#using-the-cublaslt-api) library call. Note that this phase may introduce noticeable overhead when inputs are relatively small.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **PLANNING PHASE:** This is where cuBLASLt analyzes the prepared data from the `Matmul` object and performs a search for a suitable algorithm to effectively perform the operation. It uses internal heuristics to select the most promising algorithm. The planning phase also introduces noticeable overhead before actual computation begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **EXECUTION PHASE:** This is the phase where actual computation occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PHASE:** This is the final phase where `Matmul` resources are released. Did you notice the respective INFO line `The Matmul object's resources have been released` in the log?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation for Stateful APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that our workflow assumes a **series of matrix multiplications**. In this scenario, for each matrix multiplication we go through all phases over and over again. What if matrix shapes and layouts do not change? What if input `dtypes` do not change? In this case, it would be desirable to perform the *specification* and *planning* once and amortize their cost through *multiple executions*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly for this more sophisticated scenario, **nvmath-python** offers the **stateful** (or **class-form**) API for matrix-matrix multiplication. In this API, you construct an object (an instance of the class `Matmul`, which has methods `plan()` and `execute()`, allowing them to be invoked separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "Did you notice the line in the logger stating `The Matmul operation has been created`? nvmath-python uses *stateful* APIs under-the-hood, and *stateless* APIs are just convenience wrappers around stateful API calls.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored **nvmath-python**'s stateful APIs and autotuning capabilities. These advanced features are essential for achieving optimal performance in production workloads involving repeated operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- **nvmath-python** operations consist of four phases: specification, planning, execution, and resource management.\n",
    "- Stateless (function-form) APIs are convenient but repeat all phases for each call.\n",
    "- Stateful (class-form) APIs allow you to perform specification and planning once, then execute multiple times with different data.\n",
    "- For batch processing, stateful APIs provide significant performance improvements by amortizing setup overhead.\n",
    "- Autotuning searches for optimal kernels beyond default heuristics, providing additional performance gains.\n",
    "- The cost of autotuning can be amortized across many executions using stateful APIs.\n",
    "- Use the **nvmath-python** logging mechanism to understand which phases consume time and optimize accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Explore FFT callbacks in the next notebook: [04_callbacks.ipynb](04_callbacks.ipynb)\n",
    "- Discover device APIs: [05_device_api.ipynb](05_device_api.ipynb)\n",
