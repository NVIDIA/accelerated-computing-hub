    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real-world problems in scientific computing, engineering, and data science involve solving large systems of linear equations. When these systems have coefficient matrices where most elements are zero (sparse matrices), specialized algorithms become essential for efficient computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A *sparse direct solver* uses factorization techniques (such as LU or Cholesky decomposition) specifically optimized for sparse matrices to find exact solutions to linear systems. Unlike iterative methods that approximate solutions, direct solvers provide accurate results in a predictable number of operations, making them ideal for applications requiring high precision.\n",

    "- CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) format for the $A$ matrix representation\n",
    "- Various matrix types: general, symmetric, Hermitian, SPD, and HPD matrices\n",
    "- GPU-only and hybrid CPU-GPU execution spaces for optimal performance on different problem sizes\n",

We distinguish explicit batching, where the samples of a batch are a sequence of matrices (or vectors for the RHS), and implicit batching, where the samples are inferred from 3D or higher-dimensional tensors for the LHS and RHS. The batching for the LHS and RHS can be independent - the LHS can be batched explicitly while the RHS can be batched implicitly and *vice-versa*. Each sample in an explicitly batched system can be of different size (number of equations), resulting in a flexible user interface.\n",
