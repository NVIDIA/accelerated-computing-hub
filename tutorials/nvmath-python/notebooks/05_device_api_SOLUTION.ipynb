    "**American Call Option:**\n",
    "An American call option gives the holder the **right, but not the obligation**, to **buy** an underlying asset (such as a stock) at a predetermined strike price **at any time before or on the expiration date** `T`. The key feature that distinguishes American options from European options is this ability to exercise early. The holder profits when the asset price exceeds the strike price, with the payoff being `max(S - K, 0) - Premium`, where `S` is the spot price, `K` is the strike price, and `Premium` is the initial cost paid for the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**American Put Option:**\n",
    "An American put option gives the holder the **right, but not the obligation**, to **sell** an underlying asset at a predetermined strike price **at any time before or on the expiration date** `T`. Similar to the call option, it can be exercised at any point during its lifetime. The holder profits when the asset price falls below the strike price, with the payoff being `max(K - S, 0) - Premium`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Can be exercised at any time up to expiration (unlike European options which can only be exercised at expiration)\n",
    "- **Premium**: The upfront cost paid to acquire the option\n",
    "- **Strike Price**: The predetermined price at which the transaction can occur\n",
    "- **Intrinsic Value**: The immediate profit if exercised now (can be zero if out-of-the-money)\n",
    "- **Time Value**: Additional value due to the possibility of favorable price movements before expiration\n"
