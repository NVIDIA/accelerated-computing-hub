    "## Exercise: Implement a sparse solver for multiple RHS using nvmath-python\n",
    "\n",
    "**nvmath-python** supports batched operands in the sparse solver. We distinguish explicit batching, where the samples of a batch are a sequence of matrices (or vectors for the RHS), and implicit batching, where the samples are inferred from 3D or higher-dimensional tensors for the LHS and RHS. The batching for the LHS and RHS can be independent - the LHS can be batched explicitly while the RHS can be batched implicitly and *vice-versa*. Each sample in an explicitly batched system can be of different size (number of equations), resulting in a flexible user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will implement an implicit batching for multiple RHS, represented as a matrix. For simplicity you will use randomly generated RHS. To control the correctness you will compute the L2-norm residual."
