    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This full-day hands-on tutorial teaches how to accelerate portable HPC applications with CPUs and GPUs using the parallelism and concurrency features of the Fortran 2008, 2018 and 2023 standards. Attendees will accelerate a canonical PDE solver for the unsteady heat equation from a single threaded implementation to a multi-CPU/multi-GPU implementation that overlaps computation with communication. Along the way, they will learn about Fortran concurrency features like do concurrent, math intrinsics. The tutorial teaches how to integrate these features into hybrid HPC applications using MPI.\n",
