    "* When they appear inline with the text; directive names, clauses, function or subroutine names, variable names, file names, commands and command-line arguments should appear between two back ticks.\n",

    "\n",
    "To ensure that the code in the notebooks is easy to understand and maintain, please follow these documentation guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Comments**: Add comments to explain the purpose of the code, especially for complex logic. Use inline comments for small explanations and block comments for larger sections.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Load the dataset\n",
    "    data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",

    "    # Fill missing values using forward fill method\n",
    "    data = data.fillna(method='ffill')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Docstrings**: Use docstrings to describe functions, classes, and methods. Include information about parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def preprocess_data(data):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Preprocess the input data by filling missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Parameters:\n",
    "        data (DataFrame): The input data to preprocess.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Returns:\n",
    "        DataFrame: The preprocessed data.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        return data.fillna(method='ffill')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Descriptive Variable Names**: Use clear and descriptive variable names that convey the purpose of the variable.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Split the data into features (X) and target (y)\n",
    "    features = data.drop('target', axis=1)\n",
    "    target = data['target']\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Section Headers**: Use markdown headers to organize the notebook into sections. This helps readers navigate through the content easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Explain Outputs**: After displaying outputs (e.g., plots, tables), add markdown cells to explain what the output shows and its significance.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.hist(data['column_name'])\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",

    "* Clearly label exercises with a heading, such as `## Exercise`.\n",
