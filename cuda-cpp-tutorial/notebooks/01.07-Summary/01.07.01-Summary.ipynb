    "\n",
    "Let's recap a few key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CUDA Compilation:** Use the `nvcc` to compile your CUDA C++ code\n",
    "- **Accelerated Libraries:** Leverage highly optimized libraries to accelerate your application:\n",
    "  - Thrust for general-purpose parallel algorithms\n",
    "  - cuSPARSE and CUTLASS for linear algebra \n",
    "  - MatX for array-based numerical computing\n",
    "  - etc. \n",
    "- **Execution Space Specifiers:** Use `__host__ __device__` execution space specifiers to specify where given function could be executed\n",
    "- **Execution Policies:** Use `thrust::host` and `thrust::device` execution policies to specify where given thrust algorithm will be executed\n",
    "- **Extend Algorithms:** When existing libraries do not cover your use cases, use fancy iterators to extend them\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have time left or want to explore more, \n",
    "consider [the advanced section](../01.08-Advanced/01.08.01-Advanced.ipynb) of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the first part of the course!  You have accomplished all of the following lab objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the differences between parallel and serial algorithms\n",
    "- Control where your C++ code runs and run it on CPU or GPU\n",
    "- Control whether your data resides in CPU or GPU memory and how to move between them \n",
    "- Refactor standard algorithms to execute on GPU\n",
    "- Leverage powerful parallel algorithms that simplify adding GPU acceleration to your code\n",
    "- Use fancy iterators to fuse operations and extend algorithms to fit your unique use cases \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "If you are ready to move on, proceed to the next lab, [Unlocking the GPUâ€™s Full Potential: Asynchrony and CUDA Streams](../02.01-Introduction/02.01.01-Introduction.ipynb), \n",
