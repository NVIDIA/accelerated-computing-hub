    "This library seeks to meet the needs of:​\n",
    "- Researchers seeking productivity, interoperability with other libraries and frameworks, and performance​\n",
    "- Library/Framework developers seeking out-of-the-box performance and better maintainability through Python​\n",
    "- Kernel developers seeking for highest performance without the need to switch to CUDA​\n",
